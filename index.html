            <h2 id="one">What is ocean acidification</h2>

            <p>
                “Ocean acidification” is a decrease in the pH of ocean water, driven by CO2 reacting with the water
                to
                form a weak acid. The ocean is currently a weak “alkaline” – the opposite of an acid – so the phrase
                “acidification” does not mean that the ocean is becoming an acid. Instead, it means that the ocean
                is
                becoming less alkaline and moving closer to a “neutral” pH.</p>



            <p>Carbon is constantly cycling between the atmosphere, land and ocean. However, carbon is currently
                entering the ocean faster than it is leaving, largely due to human activity. There are two main ways
                that the ocean takes up carbon from the atmosphere – the “biological” carbon pump, and the
                “physical”
                carbon pump.</p>

            <p> Sabine discusses how ocean acidification was first “discovered”:</p>

                    <p>The physical carbon pump – also known as the “solubility” pump – describes the process of CO2
                        from the atmosphere entering the ocean through diffusion. <mark>Diffusion is the movement
                            of molecules
                            across a “concentration gradient” from areas of low pressure to areas of high
                            pressure.</mark>
                        This is
                        a basic law of physics Sabine explains:
                    </p>

                    <div class="long-quote">&ldquo;The physical
                        pump is a simple
                        law of
                        thermodynamics,
                        or a
                        physical
                        property of any
                        gases
                        that a
                        gas will always move from a high concentration to low concentration. So you've got CO2 in the
                        atmosphere, and you've got CO2 in the ocean. And whichever is higher – it will go from that
                        medium to the other medium.&rdquo;</div>

        <div class="row central">
            <p>Human activity is causing atmospheric CO2 levels to rise, making the level of CO2 – more specifically
                the “partial pressure” – higher in the atmosphere than in the ocean. This means that, via diffusion,
                CO2 is moving from the atmosphere into the ocean.</p>

            <p>It takes roughly one year for a change in atmospheric CO2 to balance out with ocean levels through
                diffusion alone. However, there are many factors that can affect diffusion.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="container-fluid">
            <div class="row">

                <div class="col-sm-6 paddingleft" style="padding-right: auto;">
                    <p>For example, if the water is choppy and there are lots of breaking waves, the bubbles of air
                        mixed into the water will speed up diffusion of CO2 into the water. During high-intensity winds,
                        these bubbles can be responsible for half of the CO2 transfer between the air and ocean.</p>

                    <p>This is because breaking waves increase the surface area between the water and air, Sabine
                        explains:</p>

                    <div class="long-quote">&ldquo;Water is a very viscous fluid, and the exchange [of gasses] between
                        the air and the water
                        surface is very difficult because of surface tension and other properties of water. A breaking
                        wave that injects air into the water creates a bubble – and the smaller bubbles in particular
                        have a lot of surface area. So there's a lot of opportunity to exchange, rather than just like a
                        calm lake surface that has very limited surface area.&rdquo;</div>

                    <p>Temperature can also affect the solubility pump. It is well established that cold water can hold
                        more CO2 than warm water. (This is for the same reason that fizzy drinks tend to go flat more
                        quickly in warmer weather.) This means that ocean acidification can be “more drastic” in colder
                        regions, Dr Ramessur tells Carbon Brief.</p>


                    <p>It also means that as the planet warms, the oceans are able to hold less CO2. One study estimates
                        that by the end of the 21st century, warming will reduce the uptake of anthropogenic CO2 by the
                        ocean by 9-15%.</p>

                    <p>Temperature can also influence ocean circulation. Ocean water is constantly circulating through
                        different depths of the ocean. However as temperatures rise, the layers in the ocean are
                        separating
                        out more – a process called stratification. This can alter the concentration gradient of CO2
                        between
                        the ocean and atmosphere and change the rate of diffusion.</p>

            <div class="col-sm-6 paddingleft">
                <p>The second way that CO2 can enter the water is through the “biological carbon pump”. This process
                    is driven by microscopic plants – collectively called “phytoplankton” – that live near the
                    surface of the water and take in CO2 for photosynthesis. </p>

                <p>Phytoplankton are often eaten by zooplankton or larger organisms, which in turn are eaten by even
                    larger organisms further up the food chain. The plant and animal life eventually dies and sinks
                    to the bottom of the ocean, burying the carbon with them. During this process, around 10% of the
                    total carbon biomass ends up as fecal matter or dead cells that also sink to the bottom of the
                    ocean

                <p>Only around 0.2 Pg of carbon makes it from the surface of the ocean to the depths each year. However,
                    Sabine explains that the carbon could be stored in sediments for millenia or longer, making it an
                    important biological carbon sink:
                </p>

                <div class="long-quote">&ldquo;On the land when a plant dies, it just falls to the ground, decomposes
                    and releases its co2.
                    However in the ocean when that plant dies, it sinks down into the ocean where it decomposes. It
                    takes that carbon and it releases it down in the deep ocean. The circulation of the ocean is very
                    slow, so that carbon may be stuck in the ocean down the deep ocean or 1000 years or more... And what
                    that does is that creates a gradient so you have low co2 in the surface, high co2 and the
                    deep.&rdquo;</div>

        </h2>
    </div>


    <div class="row central equation">
        <div class="col-sm-6 paddingleft">
            <p class="black">Ocean acidification is driven by carbon dioxide reacting with water to form carbonic
                acid. Changes in
                acidity
                are usually calculated using pH – a measure of the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) in a liquid.
                The pH
                scale runs from zero to 14, where a pH of seven is “neutral”, below seven is acid and above seven is
                alkaline. This means that an increase in H+ ions makes a liquid more acidic and gives it a lower pH.
            </p>

            <p class="black">pH is “a fundamental chemical property that controls a whole bunch of different
                processes in the
                ocean”,
                Sabine tells Carbon Brief, adding that “a lot of the chemical reactions that occur in the ocean are
                a
                function of pH”.</p>

            <p class="black">The ocean has a pH above seven, making it an alkaline. However, its pH has declined
                from 8.2 to 8.1
                on
                average since the industrial era, due to human activity. This seemingly small change actually
                corresponds to
                a 30% increase in the concentration of H+ ions because the pH scale is “logarithmic”.

                    <p class="black"><mark style="background-color: #adf9a2;">Ocean acidification begins with the
                            reaction
                            between water
                            and carbon dioxide to form
                            a
                            weak acid
                            called
                            carbonic acid.</mark>
                </div>

            </div>



            <div class=stickyequation2>
                <p><mark style="background-color: #ef7f9d;">The carbonic acid breaks down into a
                        bicarbonate ion and a hydrogen ion in a
                        process
                        called dissociation.</mark> </p>
            </div>



            <div class=stickyequation3>

                <p><mark style="background-color: #edb4ed;">The bicarbonate ion can then dissociate again into a
                        carbonate ion
                        and
                        another
                        hydrogen ion.</mark>
                </p>

            </div>

            <p class=" black">The bicarbonate and hydrogen are ions because they have a positive or negative charge,
                shown by the +
                and - symbols. The chemical equation for this reaction is shown in the diagram.</p>

            <p class="black">Sabine explains that these ions combined are called “dissolved inorganic carbon”:</p>

            <div class="long-quote black">&ldquo;CO2 enters the ocean, as a gas, but then it reacts with the water
                molecules
                to form carbonic
                acid,
                bicarbonate and carbonate ions. All these different ions together form what's called the total CO2
                or
                the dissolved inorganic carbon of the oceans.&rdquo;</div>

            <p class="black">He adds that when CO2 molecules enter the ocean, around 99% of them react with water
                molecules to
                form
                these other “species”. This keeps the concentration gradient – the difference between atmospheric
                and
                oceanic levels of CO2 – high, driving further diffusion of CO2 into the water. This is “why the
                oceans
                are so efficient at absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere”, according to Sabine.</p>

            <p class="black">The chemical reactions are reversible, as shown by the double-headed arrows, meaning
                they
                can
                progress
                either forwards or backwards. The aim is to reach a “balanced equilibrium”, where none of the
                products
                or reactants are present in excessively high levels.</p>

            <p class="black">In the modern-day climate, for example, CO2 is constantly entering the ocean. To
                prevent
                levels of
                CO2
                from building up, the reaction between CO2 and water speeds up, and the reaction is pushed
                “forwards”.
                This drives the production of more H+ ions, causing the ocean to acidify.</p>

            <p class="black">However, the reaction can also be pushed “backwards” if a body of water has naturally
                high
                levels of
                bicarbonate ions or carbonate ions. The concentration of these ions is referred to as the
                “alkalinity”
                of the ocean and is generally higher in regions with natural deposits of calcium carbonate in the
                surrounding land.</p>

            <p class="black">For example, limestone is a sedimentary rock composed mainly of calcium carbonate
                (CaCO3),
                usually in
                the form of calcite or aragonite. Weathering of limestone can release calcium carbonate into the
                water,
                where it can break down to form calcium and bicarbonate ions.</p>

            <p class="black">The resistance of the water to a change in pH is called “buffer capacity”. Sabine
                explains
                the idea
                of
                buffer capacity more clearly below:</p>

            <div class="long-quote black">&ldquo;If you were to just add an acid to [ocean] water, the pH change in
                the
                ocean
                would be smaller
                than
                it would be in say freshwater, because there's a lot of bicarbonate already in the water that's
                buffering it.&rdquo;</div>


            <div class="long-quote black">&ldquo;Sabine talking head - buffering capacity. 23:10&rdquo;</div>

            <div class="iframe-container">
                <!-- <canvas id="floatingbubbles"></canvas> -->
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ARPKfAjZj-8"

            </div>

            <p class="black">However, as CO2 continues to enter the water, the buffer capacity of the oceans is
                dropping. Under a
                high
                emission scenario, it is expected that buffer capacity could decrease by 34% between 2000-2100,
                reducing
                the ability of the ocean to resist a change in pH.

            <p>
                CO2 dissolves more easily in cold water than warm water, making polar regions more vulnerable to ocean
                acidification than tropical regions. The Arctic is the most susceptible region to ocean acidification in
                the world, partly due to the cold temperatures.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Arctic is also vulnerable to acidification because it has a naturally low buffer capacity. Buffer
                capacity, as discussed earlier, is the ability of a liquid to resist changes in pH. For oceans, the
                ability to resist acidification is largely determined by the levels of bicarbonate ions, carbonate ions
                and calcium carbonate in the water.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the Arctic, levels of calcite and aragonite – both types of calcium carbonate – are naturally low.
                Furthermore, fresh water from melting ice sheets dilutes the concentrations of calcite and aragonite.
                This means that the Arctic is unable to easily resist drops in pH.

            <div class="col-sm-6 paddingright">
                <p>Ocean acidification can also be exacerbated by an influx of nutrients, human pollution and freshwater
                    from the land, which makes coastlines particularly vulnerable, Gattuso tells Carbon Brief:</p>

                <div class="long-quote">&ldquo;“Pollution, for example untreated sewage, contributes a lot of organic
                    matter – particulate and
                    dissolved. Then you get lots of microbes respiring for this organic matter of generating CO2. The
                    CO2
                    generated by land pollution can contribute significantly at a local scale to ocean
                    acidification.”&rdquo;</div>


                <p>Similarly, nitrogen and phosphorus from fertilisers running into the ocean can cause “eutrophication”
                    –
                    when an influx of nutrients into the water causes an initial bloom of phytoplankton, Sabine
                    explains:
                </p>

                <p>The phytoplankton can blanket the surface of the water, suffocating the marine life beneath and
                    causing low oxygen levels – known as “hypoxia”. In some instances this can kill marine life, which
                    then decomposes and releases carbon into the water, causing acidification.

                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="row central">


                <p>When the phytoplankton die near coasts, they are often unable to sink deep down into the ocean as
                    they would do in the open water, and instead decompose near the surface of the water, releasing more
                    carbon and causing the surface water to acidify further, Sabine explains:
                </p>

                <p>Sabine adds that rivers can affect coastal pH levels – either increasing or decreasing the pH
                    depending on the material that they are carrying:
                </p>

                <div class="long-quote">&ldquo;Organic carbon that gets washed off of the land into the rivers. You
                    think about these brown rivers – such as the Mississippi River – that are full of organic matter. As
                    that decomposes it releases CO2… It really depends on the type of soil and rocks that the river is
                    flowing through that determines whether a river contributes to acidification, or actually some
                    rivers can reduce acidification. If you have rivers that flow through carbonate material and it's
                    dissolving those carbonates, you can have these high alkalinity rivers. If you have rivers that flow
                    through carbonate material and it's dissolving those carbonates, you can have these high alkalinity
                    rivers.
                    &rdquo;</div>

                <p>Ramessur adds that fresh water – which has a “neutral” pH around seven – will decrease ocean pH. He
                    adds that climate change is expected to bring “more rain, more runoff and more discharge” which will
                    further contribute to this effect.</p>

                <p>Ocean acidification can be exacerbated by the “upwelling” of CO2-rich water rising from the deep
                    ocean, which causes pH to drop. Gattuso notes that such upwellings are particularly prevalent around
                    coastlines:</p>

                <div class="long-quote">&ldquo;An upwelling is an area where deep water, due to ocean circulation, is
                    pushed to the surface. CO2 is more abundant in deep waters usually, because of microbial
                    respiration. So when deep water is brought to the surface, it acidifies the water because there is
                    low pH. It also brings nutrients – nitrates and phosphates – triggering phytoplankton blooms. There
                    are very active areas that are along the west coast of the US, South America, the west coast of
                    Africa. Those upwellings are places where there is a very active fishing industry.&rdquo;</div>

                <p>Gattuso adds that near the coast, emissions of sulphur dioxide (SO2) from ships and factories can
                    produce acid rain, which can also exacerbate acidification. He says that this effect is “not
                    significant”, but that “it can be measured close to very industrialised areas”.</p>

                <p>Carbon dioxide can also enter the ocean through volcanic vents on the sea bed that can affect entire
                    columns of water. However, the effect that these have on overall acidification levels is negligible.

                <p>Ocean acidification can affect marine life in ways that are less immediately noticeable, but no less
                    damaging, than the impact on coral reefs and calcifying organisms.</p>

                <p>For example, acidification can reduce the ability of marine plankton to form their skeletons through
                    a similar mechanism as the weakening of corals and shelled organisms. This can drive a range of
                    evolutionary changes – for example by altering the competitive fitness between different
                    phytoplankton species and thereby changing phytoplankton community structures. </p>

                <p>Acidification can also reduce the rate of photosynthesis in plants and plankton – an impact that
                    is often exacerbated by warming. Hassoun explains the damage caused by changes in phytoplankton
                    populations:
                </p>

                <div class="long-quote">&ldquo;Phytoplankton are actually the base of the marine trophic chain. And when
                    these little creatures are discurbed, then the whole marine trophic chain reaction – up to marine
                    mammals – can also be influenced.&rdquo;</div>

                <p>For example, phytoplankton are also the ocean’s main source of certain types of fatty acids, which
                    are important for the growth and reproduction in creatures like copepods. Scientists have found that
                    low pH can change the ratio of different types of fatty acids in phytoplankton when they are exposed
                    to lower pH water.
                </p>

                <p>In addition to the wider impacts from the food chain, ocean acidification can also have a wide range
                    of direct impacts on larger species. Acidification has been shown to impact immune systems in some
                    marine organisms, making them more vulnerable to harmful pathogens.
                </p>

                <p>An increase in H+ ion concentration can also disrupt the balance of ions in the membranes of a fish’s
                    gills, and can cause physical changes to the gills. Acidification can also affect the metabolism of
                    fish – forcing them to use more energy to maintain their own acid-base balance.</p>

                <p>Many species also find it more difficult to find shelter as a result of decreasing pH. This partly
                    because the acidification can affect their habitats – for example, by damaging corals or
                    pH-sensitive plants. It is also because acidification leads to “info-disruption”, in which a fish’s
                    senses – such as sight and smell – are altered by the changing pH.
                </p>

                <p>Poertnet explains that this is due to changes in organisms’ neurotransmitters – the “chemical
                    messengers” that carry messages from neurons:
                </p>

                <div class="long-quote">&ldquo;There is an impact on neurotransmitter metabolism and function which can
                    reduce the capacity of individuals to have proper orientation when moving, to perceive and find prey
                    or to respond properly to the presence of predators.&rdquo;</div>

                <p>Neurotransmitter damage can drive behaviour changes – such as shifting levels of aggression that can
                    reshape hierarchies within species, or changes in the ability of species to avoid predators – that
                    can affect population numbers.
                </p>

                <p>Acidification can also impact reproduction and early development in fish. Studies have shown that
                    fish spawning decreases in more acidic waters, and that fish eggs and larvae are negatively affected
                    by ocean acidification. There is also research suggesting that juvenile fish are more sensitive to
                    changes in pH than adult fish.
                </p>

                <p>Ramessur tells Carbon Brief that these impacts on marine life could have a knock-on impact on people
                    through both tourism and disruption to the fishing industry, resulting in an “economic disaster” for
                    many communities:</p>

                <div class="long-quote">&ldquo;“Ocean acidification can have an impact on both fisheries and tourism… If
                    you rely on coral reefs for the tourism industry, and ocean acidification causes destruction of the
                    reefs, you will obviously have a problem.”&rdquo;</div>

                <p>For example, pteropods are a key food source for North Pacific salmon, which is responsible for 90%
                    of the salmon consumed by humans. However, Gatusso tells Carbon Brief that there are worries over
                    the stability of pteropod populations that could threaten the quality of the salmon:</p>

                <div class="long-quote">&ldquo;In the North Pacific, pteropods at some times of the year represent
                    nearly 90% of the food for North Pacific salmon. There are worries about the potential disappearance
                    of pteropods in the north, especially because of its impact on salmon. And we are not well equipped
                    to make predictions on what could occur because obviously an ecological niche, never stays empty. So
                    if the pteropods disappear, they will be replaced by another zooplankton type, but what is unknown
                    is whether this new food for salmon will have the same benefits, food quality etc.&rdquo;</div>

                <p>There are also direct human impacts of ocean acidification on people. For example, some species of
                    toxic algae have been found to benefit from ocean acidification – especially near coastlines. </p>

                <h2>‘The deadly trio’ – Acidification, warming and deoxygenation
                </h2>

                <p>Ocean acidification alone can have a significant impact on marine life, as shown above. However, this
                    is not the only stressor facing marine life today. More than 90% of the excess heat released due
                    greenhouse gases is stored in the oceans, which have warmed by around 1C due to human activity.</p>

                <p>Many species have a limited thermal tolerance in which they can survive. If climate change increases
                    temperatures beyond a species’ tolerance, they can experience negative impacts from heat stress, and
                    so they are forced to migrate away from their usual habitat to cooler waters.</p>

                <p>Marine migration is also causing problems with invasive species. Research shows that endemic species
                    – those that live in only one region – are generally more sensitive to the negative impacts of
                    climate change, and so they are at risk of being outcompeted by invading species.</p>

                <p>The majority of fish species respond negatively to warming temperatures, research shows, and so many
                    fisheries are already seeing these impacts. Research also shows that ocean heatwaves have become 34%
                    more likely over the past century.</p>

                <p>For species that are unable to leave to cooler waters, warming can be very detrimental. For example,
                    ocean warming means that severe coral reef bleaching events now five times more frequent than 40
                    years ago, and have driven a decrease in global coral reefs.</p>

                <p>Warmer water is also able to hold less oxygen, and oceans have seen a 2% decrease in oxygen content
                    of the past 50 years. Low oxygen levels can affect species metabolism, and has already led to the
                    formation of “dead zones” in which many marine species cannot survive.</p>

                <p>These three impacts – warming, deoxygenation and acidification – are often found together. For
                    example eutrophication – an influx of nutrients into the water, as discussed earlier – often combine
                    the impacts of deoxygenation, acidification and warming to create “dead zones”.</p>

                <p>Poertner explains that this combination of impacts due to eutrophication is particularly significant
                    in coastal areas:</p>

                <div class="long-quote">&ldquo;Often, the development of hypoxia and high CO2 levels go together in the
                    warming seas, trends which may be exacerbated further by anthropogenic eutrophication, especially in
                    coastal areas&rdquo;.</div>

                <p>Research also shows that their combined impacts are additive. This means that the combination of
                    these three stressors can negatively impact marine life more than a single stressor can.</p>

                <p>Poertner has conducted extensive research into the concurrent impacts of these three stressors, and
                    tells Carbon Brief that ocean acidification is “exacerbating hypoxia”, and “can narrow the thermal
                    range exploited by a species”.</p>

                <p>A special report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change notes that the combined effects
                    of warming, deoxygenation, and acidification could impact the body size, growth, reproduction and
                    mortality of fish. These factors can all increase the risk of population decline, the report says.
                </p>

                <p>Hassoun tells Carbon Brief that even phytoplankton are impacted by a range of environmental factors:
                </p>

                <div class="long-quote">&ldquo;“Phytoplankton are very sensitive and fragile creatures. The majority of
                    them are floating on the surface of seawater, and they are affected by not only seawater
                    biogeochemistry and phenomena, but also by atmospheric chemistry as well. So the increase of CO2 in
                    the atmosphere, the increase of temperature etc.&rdquo;</div>

                <p>Dr Helena Martins, science communicator in the Rossby Centre at the Swedish Meteorological and
                    Hydrological Institute told Carbon Brief in a guest post on potential “ocean tipping points” that
                    the combination of these three impacts could cause “ecosystem-wide shifts”:</p>

                <div class="long-quote">&ldquo;“While these different processes are individually a danger to marine
                    life, in combination with other threats – such as overfishing, high nutrient input from land and
                    invasive species – they have the potential to cause ecosystem-wide regime shifts.&rdquo;</div>

                <p>A recent paper referring to acidification, warming and deoxygenation as “the deadly trio” finds that
                    under an extremely high emission scenario, extreme acidification events, marine heatwaves and
                    hypoxic events will become “potentially more devastating”.</p>

                <p>This trend is concerning, Gatusso notes, because the five mass extinctions of ocean life that
                    occurred in the past all involved a combination of these three stressors:</p>

                <div class="long-quote">&ldquo;The five mass extinctions which occurred in the past all had similar
                    ingredients in the ocean – warming, acidification, and loss of oxygen. Extreme conditions in these
                    variables - with other parameters of course - led to mass extinctions. I’m not reducing mass
                    extinctions to those three things, but clearly a correlation is here. And this is exactly the recipe
                    that will occur in the future.&rdquo;</div>

                <p>As such, it is important to monitor the impact of all three factors together, rather than studying
                    them in isolation, Hassoun explains:</p>

                <div class="long-quote">&ldquo;It's important when we talk about ocean acidification to monitor this
                    phenomenon, not as something that is happening alone, but as something that is happening in parallel
                    with other stressors… There are many experimental studies about the potential effects of ocean
                    acidification on phytoplankton, zooplankton, shrimp, many types of fish, etc. These experiments are
                    interesting, and they can tell us so much. However, the majority of them are tackling the problem of
                    ocean acidification solely, which is not enough. We need to have this multi stressor experimental
                    studies.&rdquo;</div>
